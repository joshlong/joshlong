### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on helping people get to production faster. I've got a [Bootiful Podcast](http://bootifulpodcast.fm), my YouTube series [Spring Tips](http://springtipslive.io), my latest book, [_Reactive Spring_](http://www.reactivespring.io/), my [Livelessons](http://joshlong.com/livelessons.html) training videos, my weekly [blogs](http://spring.io/team/joshlong), my code (you're already here!), and more. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning YAML
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Spring and its adjacent communities (Yah! Let's go cloud natives!) 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with continuous delivery, YAML, Java, Kotlin, Chinese, etc.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Spring and cloud native, reactive architectures 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I'm [on Twitter (@starbuxman)](http://twitter.com/starbuxman). That's the best way. There's also [e-mail](mailto:josh@joshlong.com), though keep in mind I tend to be even more async in my replies there... 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/they
- Are you looking for a repository you saw mentioned somewhere? In December 2022, I moved more than 500 Github repositories spanning more than a decade to [`github.com/joshlong-attic`](https://github.com/joshlong-attic). These projects are those I've lost interest in, only served as a sketch or experiment or bug reproducer, are forks I no longer work on, etc. Basically, they had their time and that time has passed.
